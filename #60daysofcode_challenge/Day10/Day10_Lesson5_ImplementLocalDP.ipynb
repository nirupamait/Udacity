First, Andrew uses noise as the probability of the coin landing heads. However, when he goes to the de-skewing part, he changes the definition out of the blue and now noise becomes the probability of the coin landing heads. To check that this is what is happening, consider this:\n",

    "If H is the probability of landing heads, the probability of landing tails is (1 - H), right? So if the coin has 70% of probability of landing heads, it has 30% of landing tails. Now, this is the definitino he used first.\n",
